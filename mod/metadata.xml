  <description>RRememberAll Adds icons indicating remaining rooms to visit and objectives to complete, to avoid forgetting them.

    I highly recommend installing [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2487535818]Mod Config Menu - Continued[/url] to enable/disable rooms and other options

    This mod is compatible with Tainted rooms

    Should be compatible with any mod that changes sprites or adds custom rooms.

    Created with the [url=https://isaacscript.github.io]IsaacScript[/url] framework,

    The development of this mod is temporarily slowed down, I'll be back soon.
